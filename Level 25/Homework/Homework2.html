    <h1>Rumours</h1>
    <p>Fleetwood Mac's Rumours is one of the most iconic albums of all time. Released on February 4, 1977, it became a massive commercial success, selling over 40 million copies worldwide. The album was shaped by the band's personal turmoil—breakups, divorces, and heavy drug use—which influenced its emotionally charged lyrics and sound.    </p>
